    "content": "<p>IronPoint disbanded during the day on Friday, 2956.01.09 and screenshots circulating Spectrum showed what appeared to be an announcement stating that IronPoint was set to shut down soon after the message itself was posted.<p><p>IronPoint’s public Spectrum page shows a “Closed” statement and their member count has been reduced to zero. Their public messaging channels are all shut down and their offline communications network has also been marked as unlisted.<p><p>IronPoint, a syndicate organization once recognized by the UEE itself during their Pirate Week report, made a name for themselves by conducting aggressive and hostile actions within the fringes of UEE controlled space. IronPoint was led by DocHound, a skilled fighter pilot that got his start by hunting down bounties. DocHound eventually crossed over into piracy and began IronPoint shortly after.<p><p>Rumors state that at some point in its life IronPoint began a leaderboard style kill tracker within their internal forums. The purpose of the tracker was for each member to openly keep track of their kills and pirate activity. With the organization shutting its doors, it is currently unknown if that leaderboard has been taken down or if it has been moved to another forum.<p><p>Members of IronPoint have migrated to other organizations since the dissolution. One organization was born from the ashes of IronPoint and houses many of those who have left. The organization Likely Suspects (NOTME) has been formed as a direct result of the closure, even stating in their public history that they are formed from the remnants of IronPoint.<p><p>Despite the regime changes within the pirate community, HCN News advises that civilian pilots and haulers be on the lookout for any pirate behavior and to report it through official and public forums to those who can help. These behind-the-scenes changes may slow down pirate activity but could also cause unrest among the pirate community, which would mean increased danger on routine shipping lanes and in uncontrolled space.<p><p>While a significant number of IronPoint members have yet to make an appearance in different organizations, we can see that some have made a new home in the Likely Suspects from their Spectrum page. HCN News will look for more public roster changes and any changes in the greater pirate activity within the Stanton System. HCN News will continue to monitor the situation.<p>"

      "title": "Regular News Updates Return After UEE Investigation Halts Frontier Broadcasts",
      "subtitle": "Written news broadcasts around the frontier were halted in September of 2955 and are now returning. Relay station managers stated the restriction was due to an investigation surrounding UEE Navy operational security concerns.",
      "author": "Kaveh Virtanen | Military Correspondent",
      "date": "Stardate: 2956.01.12",
      "content": "<p>The rolling news blackout affected news outlets throughout the fringes of UEE Space. At first, HCN News assumed it was a technical glitch that was not allowing the articles to be published. We had our technical analysts and engineers check on the issue and we found that something was blocking information from being routed through communication relays. We reached out to other news sites in Stanton and found that they were encountering the same issues.<p><p>HCN News administrators then reached out to different communication relay companies and after speaking with managerial personnel were able to learn that the news articles were all being halted at the relays due to an ongoing UEE Naval investigation. The same personnel stated the investigation was looking into articles surrounding ongoing UEE Naval operations and security concerns in the recent past. Many public data banks being routed through the communication relays were also disconnected from their respective Spectrum forums for the duration of the investigation.<p><p>Micea Dravnic, our Technology Correspondent, had a few words to say on the matter, “What the viewer would see is just a lack of news articles being published on Spectrum, but that’s different from what we see here.” Dravnic further explained that at the beginning of the investigation news updates were published at normal frequency, but it was clear that nothing new was being shown on Spectrum. HCN News quickly dug into the issue and found that the articles were published locally but the broadcast was halted somehow.<p><p>After a full review, and several months to look into the issue, it appears that the investigation was extremely narrow in scope. Our articles that observed UEE Naval activity within Pyro and our more politically charged articles were not taken down during the investigation. It simply halted the publication of any new articles.<p><p>Readers can expect that over the next few weeks there will be regular reporting through the news sites as before. There may also be legacy articles that were never published during the blackout that begin to appear on the news side of HCN Radio. Both the market and the news feeds will begin populating over the next few days and regular operations will return.<p>"
