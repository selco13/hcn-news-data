# üîß HOW THE AUTO-DISCOVERY WORKS
**Behind the scenes, the system**
1.	**Tries to load** an index file if it exists (for faster loading)
2.	**If no index exists** - Automatically checks the last 60 days for news files
3.	**Builds the edition list** dynamically based on files it finds
4.	**Updates automatically** whenever you add new files
**This means**
* ‚úÖ **Zero maintenance** - Just upload daily files
* ‚úÖ **No coordination needed** - Multiple reporters can work independently
* ‚úÖ **Automatic updates** - New files appear immediately
* ‚úÖ **Error-proof** - No chance of forgetting to update index files

# üì∞ HCN DISPATCH REPORTER GUIDE - MULTI-REPORTER WORKFLOW
## üöÄ MULTIPLE REPORTERS? NO PROBLEM!
The system now supports **multiple reporters working on the same day** without conflicts. Each reporter can upload their own file using different naming conventions.
## Your File Naming Options
### Option 1: Simple Daily File
* `2024-05-24.json` - Use if you're the only reporter for the day
### Option 2: Reporter-Specific Files
* `2024-05-24-sarah.json` - Include your name
* `2024-05-24-marcus.json` - Each reporter gets their own file
* `2024-05-24-elena.json` - No conflicts possible
### Option 3: Edition-Type Files
* `2024-05-24-main.json` - Main daily edition
* `2024-05-24-breaking.json` - Breaking news updates
* `2024-05-24-morning.json` - Morning edition
* `2024-05-24-evening.json` - Evening update
* `2024-05-24-update.json` - General updates
## How Multi-File Merging Works
‚úÖ **Automatic Combination** - System merges all files for the same date
‚úÖ **Smart Prioritization** - Breaking news takes precedence
‚úÖ **No Duplicates** - Duplicate stories/updates are filtered out
‚úÖ **Latest Wins** - If same content from multiple reporters, latest version is used
